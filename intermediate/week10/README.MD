# Binary Trees

## Session 1
### Identical Trees
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### Insert into a Binary Search Tree
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST.

### List to a balanced BST
Create a balanced BST from an array. Output tree should be a valid BST and balanced. Balanced tree can have the difference of at most ONE between left and right.

### Check for Average Node
Given a binary tree, check if each node is the average of its direct children.

For example: In the tree below each node has a value which is the average of the values of its direct children


### Lowest Common Ancestor
The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is defined as the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants.

Given a binary tree and two nodes in the tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the given nodes in the tree.

## Session 2


### Print Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, print all its leaf nodes from left to right.
Extra Challenge: If we are asked to print the leaf nodes from right to left, how would you change your solution?

### Binary Tree Paths
Given a binary tree, print/return all root-to-leaf paths.

### Convert Sorted List to BST
Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a balanced BST. A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### Kth Smallest Element of a BST
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.
