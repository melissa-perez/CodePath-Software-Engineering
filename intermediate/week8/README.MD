# Strings and Arrays II

## Session 1

### Flatted a 2D Array

Convert a n x m 2D array into a (n * m) x 1 1D array.

### Island Problem

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


### Convert 1D Array to 2D

This is similar to the first problem, except you'll be implementing the reverse!

Convert a (n * m) x 1 1D array into a n x m 2D array.
