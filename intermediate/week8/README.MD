# Strings and Arrays II

## Session 1

### Flatten a 2D Array

Convert a n x m 2D array into a (n * m) x 1 1D array.

### Island Problem

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


### Convert 1D Array to 2D

This is similar to the first problem, except you'll be implementing the reverse!

Convert a (n * m) x 1 1D array into a n x m 2D array.

## Session 2

### Kth Smallest Element
Given an array and a number k where k is less than size of array, we need to find the kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

### Merge Intervals
Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.
