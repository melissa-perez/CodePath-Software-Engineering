# Strings and Arrays I

## Session 1
### Shortest Unsorted Subarray
Given an array, find the length of the smallest subarray in it which when sorted will sort the whole array.

### Run Length Encoding
Given an input string, write a function that returns the run-length encoded string for the input string.*

### Increment an arbitrary precision integer
Implement a function to increment an arbitrary precision integer represented in the form of an array, where each element in the array corresponds to a digit.
## Session 2
### String to Integer
Write a method to convert a string representation of an integer into its equivalent integer number.

### Integer to String
Write a method that takes an integer as input and returns its string representation.


###  Reverse Words in a String

Reverse the ordering of words in a sentence.

### Longest Substring with k distinct characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.


## Post-Session Assignments

### Reverse Words in A String
Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

### First Unique Character in a String
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

### Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
### Merge Sorted Arrays
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

### Run Length Encoding

Given an input string, write a function that returns the Run Length Encoded string for the input string.
For example, if the input string is “wwwwaaadexxxxxx”, then the function should return “w4a3d1e1x6”.

### Trapping Rain Water
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

### Sort colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
### Smallest Window Substring
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

### Permutation in a String
Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
