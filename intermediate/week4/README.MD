# Linked List II

## Session 1

### Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Remove the Nth node from the End of List

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

### Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Remove Duplicates

Given a linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Can you do it without taking up extra memory?

## Session 2
This session deals with fixing buggy, given code.

### Get Length of Linked List
Given a singly linked list, return its length


### Palindrome
Given a linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.


### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.



### Rotate List
Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.



### Reverse Nodes in k group
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.


## Post-Session Assignments

### Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Rotate List

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

### Sort List

Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?

### Insertion Sort List
Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.

The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
It repeats until no input elements remain.
The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.
