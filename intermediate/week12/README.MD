# Final Review


## Session 1

### Sort Squares
Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return a new array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

### Appears more than n/2

Write a function to find if a given integer x appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers.

## Session 2

None


## Post-Session Assignments

### Next Greater Element

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.
### Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.


### Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals`[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Count distinct elements in every window of size k

Given an array of size n and an integer k, return the count of distinct numbers in all windows of size k. 

### Find the Length of the largest subarray with sum 0

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-array with a sum that equals 0.

### Print all subarrays with sum 0

Given an array, print all subarrays in the array which has sum 0.

### Find if a binary tree is balanced

Given a binary tree, Find whether if a Given Binary Tree is Balanced?

### Diameter of a binary tree

Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to find the diameter of the tree.

### Search a 2D matrix

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
