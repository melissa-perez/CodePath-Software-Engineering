# Linked Lists


## Warmups
### Delete Node in Linked List
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

### Reverse Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
### Linked List Cycle
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. For this problem, it may be helpful for you to write some pseudocode on how to build a linked list with a cycle.

### Add two numbers(LSF)
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Odd Even Linked Lists
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

### Rotate List
Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.
### Swap Nodes in Pairs
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)
