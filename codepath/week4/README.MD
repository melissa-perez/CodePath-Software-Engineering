# Linked List II

## Session 1

### Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Remove the Nth node from the End of List

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

### Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Remove Duplicates

Given a linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Can you do it without taking up extra memory?

## Session 2
This session deals with fixing buggy, given code.

### Get Length of Linked List
Given a singly linked list, return its length


### Palindrome
Given a linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.


### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.



### Rotate List
Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.



### Reverse Nodes in k group
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
