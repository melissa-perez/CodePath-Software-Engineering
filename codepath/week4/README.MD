## Session 1

### Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Remove the Nth node from the End of List

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

### Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Remove Duplicates

Given a linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Can you do it without taking up extra memory?
