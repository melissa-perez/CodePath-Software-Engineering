# Hash Maps and Big O

## Session 1

### Element with k Frequency
Find the element that appears k number of times in an array.


### Longest Consecutive Subsequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, we want to find the length of the longest subsequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers. The consecutive numbers can be in any order.

### Session 2

### Find a pair with a given sum
Given an array of size n and a number x, determine the first two elements in the array, if any, whose sum is exactly x.


## Post-Session Assignments

### Intersection of Two Arrays
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.


### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
